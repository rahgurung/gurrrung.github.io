Hey, In this article Iâ€™m going to reveal ways to download Coursera videos in HD.  

Actually there are two ways to do it:
1. Using **Chrome** Extension: You can use [<u>this</u>](https://bit.ly/getCHVD) extension to download the videos in HD. All this extension will do is Add a Download In HD button to all your Coursera videos so that you can download your videos directly from your Coursera without any hassle. Oh! By the way, this plugin is made by me.
2. Firefox version is [<u>this</u>](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/coursera-hd-video-downloader/).

3. *The brave way*: This trick is advised only for web developers but can be done by anyone. First of all, you have to go to the video page that you want to download. Just let the page render completely. Then right-click on the video and Inspect it. Find the src tag of video which contains a link. Simply, paste this link in a new tab and you will see your video running in HD and you can hit Ctrl+S from here to download it. Voila ! you are a hacker now. Oh! By the way, the above extension does the same thing for you.
