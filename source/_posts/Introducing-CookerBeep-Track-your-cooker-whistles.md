Cookerbeep is a smart kitchen app designed to track the beeps of your cooker and alert you when the desired number of whistles are completed. Simply set the number of whistles you expect, and let Cookerbeep listen in. Once your cooker reaches the set count, the app will ring an alarm to notify you, ensuring your food is cooked to perfection without the need to watch the cooker constantly. Perfect for busy home cooks who want to stay focused on other tasks while ensuring their meal is ready at the right time.
